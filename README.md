Submission to the DataCamp competition "Can you help reduce employee turnover?" (https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/e9089f70-9c9a-4b5e-b1c2-94144ac12cd4)

The Board is worried about the relatively high turnover, and your team must look into ways to reduce the number of employees leaving the company.
